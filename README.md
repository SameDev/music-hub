## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, Socket.IO |
| Frontend | React, Vite, TailwindCSS, TanStack Query, React Router |
| Infra | Docker, Docker Compose, FFmpeg, yt-dlp, Nginx |

## Quickstart (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your own secrets
docker compose up
```

App available at `http://localhost`.

## Local development (without Docker)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs backend (NestJS, port 3000) and frontend (Vite, port 5173) concurrently. Requires local PostgreSQL and Redis instances (see `.env.example`).
